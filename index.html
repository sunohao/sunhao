        Welcome to the Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics research group's website. Our group is focused on constructing models of physical processes in condensed matter such as solids, liquids, gas, or plasma. Our work is driven by experimental data, generalizing the solutions of these models to make predictions, and transferring the concepts gained into other areas. Condensed Matter Theory plays an important role in understanding known phenomena and predicting new ones.
