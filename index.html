    Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics involves developing models of physical processes in these condensed systems, driven by experimental data and using these models to make predictions and transfer concepts to other areas. By understanding known phenomena and predicting new ones, Condensed Matter Theory plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the world around us.
    The last figure is from the paper published in Nature: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04726-w" target="_blank"> Strongly correlated electron-photon systems</a>.
