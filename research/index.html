Theoretical Condensed Matter physics is about building models of physical processes, often driven by experimental data, generalising the solutions of those models to make predictions, 
and transferring the concepts gained into other areas. 
Theory plays an important role in understanding known phenomena and in predicting new ones. We mainly focus on the topological aspects of the condensed matter:

<p>1. Graphene, topologcal insulators and topological semimetals</p>

<p>2. Carrier dynamics with interaction effects</p>

<p>3. Quantum spin liquid and fractional quantum Hall effect</p>
