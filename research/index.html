        I am mainly working on the ultrafast carrier dynamics in 2D materials (graphene, TMDCs, etc.) 
        with fully quantum-mechanical methods and built an excellent intuitive understanding of low-dimensional physics. 
        I am also working on the fundamental theory of topology, symmetry, and geometric effects in graphene and other 2D materials.
