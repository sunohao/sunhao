    <p>What is theoretical Condensed Matter physics</p>
    Theoretical Condensed Matter physics is about building models of physical processes, 
    often driven by experimental data, generalising the solutions of those models to make 
    predictions, and transferring the concepts gained into other areas. Theory plays an 
    important role in understanding known phenomena and in predicting new ones.

    I am mainly working on the ultrafast carrier dynamics in 2D materials (graphene, TMDCs, etc.) 
    with fully quantum-mechanical methods and built an excellent intuitive understanding of low-dimensional physics. 
    I am also working on the fundamental theory of topology, symmetry, and geometric effects in graphene and other 2D materials. 

<p>1. Graphene, topologcal insulators and topological semimetals</p>

<p>2. Carrier dynamics with interaction effects</p>

<p>3. Quantum spin liquid and fractional quantum Hall effect</p>
